## Some pictures around

This is a very simple scene, with some pictures around the
camera (point of view). 
All the files referenced here are in the `pictures-01` directory
in this repository.


[Check the actual scene in your browser](pictures.html).

If you see it in a AR WebXR capable browser (such as recent versions
of Chrome in Android 9 or higher, or some AR glasses),
you can try "entering AR mode".
If you see the AR icon next to the usual VR icon, just click on it.
You will be queried for permission for entering AR mode, and then
you will see the scene superimposed on the reality.
Enter AR mode with the mobile screen in front of you, vertical,
and you will see the pictures hanging around you.
