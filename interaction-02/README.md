## Selecting objects

Interacting with the scene means not only moving around,
but also selecting objects.
For that, we will use some mechanism to "select" an object in the scene,
and then raising some event in the corresponding HTML element.
The element will detect that event, and act accordingly.
This is the way selection and actions following selection usually occur in
web front-end programming, so the model will look familiar to people used to
build web front-end applications.

### Raising events with the mouse

When we're in desktop, we can raise events in objects with the mouse.
For that, we need a `cursor` element in the scene,
as an element within the scene
(this is how we will include in the following examples):

```html
<a-scene>
  <a-entity cursor="rayOrigin:mouse"></a-entity>
</a-scene>
```

The cursor is basically defining a ray, which may "touch"
some object, selecting it. Since for now we're using it with a mouse,
we want the ray to come "from the object to where the mouse points".
This is what `rayOrigin:mouse` does.

To find out that we're actually selecting objects, and raising event in them,
we need to define some handler for those events in the objects themselves.
We can for example use the
[animation component](https://aframe.io/docs/1.4.0/components/animation.html):
this will make the box "jump" when we click on it

```html
      <a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#4CC3D9" shadow
        animation="startEvents: click; property: position;
          from: -1 1.5 -3; to: -1 0.5 -3 dur: 1000">
      </a-box>
```

That is: when the "click" event is detected in this object,
make it go from Y=1.5 to Y=0.5 in one second.
The efect is like if the box "jumps" and then falls down.

We can also make a sphere "grow" when clicked (by acting on its `scale` property),
and a cylinder grow when mouse enters it, and come back to its original size
when muse leaves.

```html
      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="#EF2D5E" shadow
        animation="startEvents: click; property: scale;
          from: 2 2 2; to: 1 1 1; dur: 1000">
      </a-sphere>
      <a-cylinder position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D" shadow
        animation__enter="startEvents: mouseenter; property: scale;
          to: 2 2 2; dur: 1000"
        animation__leave="startEvents: mouseleave; property: scale;
          to: 1 1 1; dur: 1000">
      </a-cylinder>

```

### Supporting controls of VR devices

Support of the Oculus controls in AFrame comes via
two components: 
[oculus-go-controls](https://aframe.io/docs/1.4.0/components/oculus-go-controls.html)
for Oculus Go, and
[oculus-touch-controls](https://aframe.io/docs/1.4.0/components/oculus-touch-controls.html)
for Rift, Rift S, Oculus Quest 1 and 2. There are components
for other devices (MagicLeap, Gear, etc).
They will handle events from the corresponding controls, if present
(so, we can add all of them to the scene, and only those that are present will work).

We're not going to use these controls directly, but by the intermediation of
a more abstract component:
[laser-controls](https://aframe.io/docs/1.4.0/components/laser-controls.html).
It sits on top of the available controls, and deals
with the raytracing to selecting an object:

```html
<a-entity laser-controls="hand: right"></a-entity>
```

That's all we need. The rest of the scene is exactly the same we had.
If we don't remove from it the `cursor` component, it will also work
in desktop, exactly the way it worked.

It is important to notice that, in Oculus, movement won't work,
since we have not included the `movement-controls` component we used when
we added that capability.

### Adding camera movement in VR devices

As we already did when [adding camera movement](../interaction-01/README.md)
for VR devices, we need a `movement-controls` component
(provided by the [A-Frame Extras library](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras)),
to use the touchpad in the Go control.
See the previous section for learning how to include A-Frame Extras,
and then include the following elements (note that `cursor` and 
`laser-controls`, that we already had are now within `movement-controls`):

```html
<a-entity movement-controls="fly: true" position="0 0 0">
  <a-entity camera position="0 1.6 0" look-controls></a-entity>
  <a-entity cursor="rayOrigin:mouse"></a-entity>
  <a-entity laser-controls="hand: right"></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

In this code, `movement-controls` adds the capabilities to move in several VR devices,
`camera` adds the camera with `look-controls` (`wasd-controls` is pulled in by `movement-controls`,
so we don't need to include it to move with arrow or WASD keys in desktop).
Finally, `cursor` and `laser-controls` work as we described above.

or check its complete [source code](https://github.com/jgbarah/aframe-playground/blob/master/interaction-02/selection-2.html).

### Now, with event handlers

We can write our own JavaScript event handlers, instead of relying
on what A-Frame components provide. This is for sure much more flexible,
since we will program any behavior we may want, but requires writing some
JaveScript code, instead of just dealing with HTML.

In this case, we will write our own A-Frame component
that behaves as we want, when it receives `click`, `mouseenter`, or
`mouseleave` events. For details on how to write a component,
read [Writing a component](https://aframe.io/docs/1.4.0/introduction/writing-a-component.html)
in the AFrame documentation.
In our case, we will focus on explaining how the event handlers
are installed by the initialization module of our component,
and how they will behave when the events are fired on it.

The JavaScript code for building the new component (`event-listener`)
should be included before the scene (we will include it in the `header` of the
HTML page):

```html
<script>
  AFRAME.registerComponent("click-listener", {
    init: function() {
      this.el.addEventListener("click", function(e) {
        console.log(e.target)
        e.target.setAttribute('scale', {x: 2, y: 2, z: 2});
        });
      this.el.addEventListener("mouseenter", function(e) {
        console.log(e.target)
        e.target.setAttribute('scale', {x: 1.5, y: 1.5, z: 1.5});
        });
      this.el.addEventListener("mouseleave", function(e) {
        console.log(e.target)
        e.target.setAttribute('scale', {x: 1, y: 1, z: 1});
        });
      }
  });
</script>
```

This code adds event listeners in the `init` function of the component.
For each of the `click`, `mouseenter`, and `mouseleave` events,
the event handler will log the event in console, and change
the `scale` attribute of the component.

For having this behavior, entities (our "bodies" in the scene)
just need to include this component:

```html
      <a-box event-listener position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0"
             color="#4CC3D9" shadow></a-box>
      <a-sphere event-listener position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25"
                color="#EF2D5E" shadow></a-sphere>
      <a-cylinder event-listener position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5"
                  height="1.5" color="#FFC65D" shadow></a-cylinder>
```
