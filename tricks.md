### Screencasting with Oculus devices

It is easy to screencast from the Oculus Quest or Go to other devices while
on virtual reality. See [detailed instruction](https://support.oculus.com/1053142614872870/),
but in short, when with the Oculus device on, press the Oculus button
on the controller, to get the menu, and select:

* "Cast to phone". You'll receive a notification in your phone
  to start receiving the screencast.
* "Cast to computer". You can point your Chrome or Edge to
  https://oculus.com/casting , enter with your Oculus account,
  and start receiving the screencast.
* "Cast to Chromecast". Select the Chromecast device you want to cast to,
  and that's all.

You can also cast from your phone (once you're receiving a cast from
the Oculus device) to a Chromecast.
