## Creating an elevation map from Copernicus data

### References

All of this is based on:

* [A-Frame Terrain Model component](https://github.com/bryik/aframe-terrain-model-component)

* [Converting terrain data to WebGL-friendly format](https://blog.mastermaps.com/2013/10/terrain-building-with-threejs-part-1.html) (and some other posts linked in this one).

### Description

I'm going to create a 3D elevation map, using Copernicus elevation data ([EU-DEM](https://land.copernicus.eu/imagery-in-situ/eu-dem/)). For that, I download two tiles, North and South of Madrid (`eu_dem_v11_E30N10.zip` and `eu_dem_v11_E30N20.zip`). I unzip them, which produces four files per tile (with extensions `TFw`, `TIF`). All of them are in directory `$demdata`.

To work with these maps, and produce maps with the information I need, I install [gdal](https://gdal.org/). In Debian, that's easy because it is a regular package:

```bash
sudo apt install gdal-bin
```

Now, I build a gdal virtual dataset with both tiles, and produce a file in ENVI format (`map.bin`) with the elevation data. I do that in the `tmp` directory, whcih I will use as a temporary storage for the intermediary maps and datasets I need: 

```bash
mkdir tmp
cd tmp
gdalbuildvrt map.vrt $demdata/eu_dem_v11_E30N10.TIF $demdata/eu_dem_v11_E30N20.TIF
gdalinfo -mm map.vrt
gdalwarp -te 3000000 2000000 3100000 2100000 map.vrt map.tif
gdalinfo -mm map.tif
gdal_translate -scale 0 2522 0 255 -outsize 200 200 -of PNG map.tif ../map.png
gdal_translate -scale 0 2522 0 65535 -ot UInt16 -outsize 200 200 -of ENVI map.tif ../map.bin
```

Let's explain the process in some more detail:

* I start by using [gdalbuildvrt](https://gdal.org/programs/gdalbuildvrt.html) to build a dataset (in this case, with two TIF files for elevation data).

* Then, we get the coordinates of the generated vrt file. These coordinated mean the data for this file is between 3 Mmeters (3,000 Km) and 4 Mmeters West, and between 1 Mmeters and 3 Mmeters North:

```
Corner Coordinates:
Upper Left  ( 3000000.000, 3000000.000) (  8d 7'39.52"W, 48d38'23.47"N)
Lower Left  ( 3000000.000, 1000000.000) (  3d40'26.43"W, 30d56'55.67"N)
Upper Right ( 4000000.000, 3000000.000) (  5d31' 4.07"E, 50d 1'26.83"N)
Lower Right ( 4000000.000, 1000000.000) (  6d39'15.95"E, 31d56'35.96"N)
Center      ( 3500000.000, 2000000.000) (  0d18'45.65"E, 40d37'27.81"N)
Band 1 Block=128x128 Type=Float32, ColorInterp=Gray
Min=-33.271 Max=3451.047   Computed Min/Max=-33.271,3451.047
```

* Then, I use [gdalwarp](https://gdal.org/programs/gdalwarp.html) to build a TIF file, `test.tif`, corresponding to a fraction of the dataset. In this case, the lower correspond to the lower left corner of the upper image included in the dataset.  Coordinates are Xmin Ymin Xmax Ymax. Have in mind that not all coordinates have values, since the map covers only Europe (and not, for example, Africa), which means that if you select a region with no values, it will say there is no elevation data, when asking for the elevation.

* Then, I check with `gdalinfo` the coordinates of the produced file, and find the max and min elevation:

```
Upper Left  ( 3000000.000, 2100000.000) (  5d41'57.17"W, 40d45'34.34"N)
Lower Left  ( 3000000.000, 2000000.000) (  5d28'46.07"W, 39d52'33.70"N)
Upper Right ( 3100000.000, 2100000.000) (  4d32' 7.72"W, 40d56'21.51"N)
Lower Right ( 3100000.000, 2000000.000) (  4d19'51.35"W, 40d 3'10.47"N)
Center      ( 3050000.000, 2050000.000) (  5d 0'39.47"W, 40d24'31.80"N)
Band 1 Block=4000x1 Type=Float32, ColorInterp=Gray
    Computed Min/Max=249.094,2521.040
```

* The first part confirms that the coordinates in `test.tif` are from 3 Mmeters W to 3.1 Mmeters W, and from 2 Mmeters N to 2.1 Mmeters N.

* Then, we produce a PNG file ([map.png](map.png)), with less resolution, to make it manageable. The first two numbers (0 2522) are the real elevation range in meters, from the TIF file, to be translated to the second two numbers (0 255), range of the PNG file (256 levels). This file is mainly to check how things are going, because you can see the relief in it, but I wonÂ´t use anymore.

* The second `gdal_translate` does the same, but producing an ENVI file ([map.bin](map.bin)), in which long integers (16 bit) can be used, thus having much better resolution.

Now, this file can already be included in the [aframe-terrain-model](https://github.com/bryik/aframe-terrain-model-component) as follows (see documentation for [A-Frame Terrain Model component](https://github.com/bryik/aframe-terrain-model-component) for details): 

``` html
<a-entity terrain-model="dem: url(map.bin);
    planeWidth: 200;
    planeHeight: 200;
    segmentsWidth: 199;
    segmentsHeight: 199;
    zPosition: 20;
    wireframe: true"
        id="terrain"></a-entity>
```

I can see the result by inserting this entity in an A-Frame scene, as I do in `wireframe.html`. [Check the actual scene in your browser](wireframe.html)

To have colored texture and hillshades, so that we can have something better than plain wireframe, we follow instructions in [Creating color relief and slope shading with gdaldem](https://blog.mastermaps.com/2012/06/creating-color-relief-and-slope-shading.html):

* Colored relief: I produce the file [color-relief.txt] (first column is elevation, the other three are RGB) for configuring colors for some elevations, and then use it to produce a image for the colored relief (`color_relief.tif`), by running (in directory `tmp`):

```bash
gdaldem color-relief map.tif ../color-relief.txt color_relief.tif
```

* Hill shades (again, in `tmp`):

```bash
gdaldem hillshade -combined map.tif hillshade.tif
```

* Then, we need [Mapnik](https://mapnik.org/) to combine the files. There are Debian packages, so, I install them: 

```bash
sudo apt install mapnik-utils python3-mapnik
```

* Now, to run mapnik, we create a XML file ([terrain.xml](terrain.xml)) specifying how to combine data (see details in [Land cover mapping with Mapnik](https://blog.mastermaps.com/2012/07/land-cover-mapping-with-mapnik.html)), and a Python file ([terrain.py](terrain.py)), which will be the driver for mapnik. In both I have to include the right files and the right coordinates for my map. Let's run that script: 

```bash
python3 terrain.py
```

This produces a nice [terrain.png](terrain.png) file, which can be used a texture for the map. I load it in a copy of the previous scene (file `terrain.html`) by adding a new property to `terrain-model`: `map: url(terrain.png);`.[Check the scene in your browser](terrain.html). Be patient: maybe the color map will take some seconds to load.

Finally, I remove the wireframe, include maps as assets, add mobility for when in VR, and some other minor details. [Check the final scene in your browser](elevation.html).
